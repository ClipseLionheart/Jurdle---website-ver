        <p>Jurdle is a fun game where you try to guess a hidden word in six guesses or less! Use your keyboard to type, and refresh to replay!</p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ul id="list">
            <li>
                Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. If it is not, the blank spaces will show up as yellow.
            </li>
            <li>
                The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the letter is in the word and in the correct spot, it will turn green.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, it will turn orange.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the letter is not in the word, it will turn gray.
            </li>
        </ul>
